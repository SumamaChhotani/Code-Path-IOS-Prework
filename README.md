## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
 # 3 Apps That I really Like:
       (1) SnapChat
             I love the filter involved which probably use AI
             I love disappearing messaging and how even a single screenshot will notify the user

       (2) Spotify
             I love sptify playlist recommendation and how they are always on point
             I love the Spotfiy USeriterface a lot
      (3) Discord
            I love the discord notifcation sounds and Bots
            I love how servers are organized on discord

  My APP IDEA
        I speak an endangered language called Memoni, and would really like to make a word
        dictionary app for that langauge. The app would function as a basic dictionary, offering easy 
        word searches and simple translations. Users could listen to audio pronunciations, making it 
        convenient for them to grasp the correct pronunciation. The app would also have interactive games to 
        make learning fun, and a community section where users can contribute new words or phrases. The goal 
        is to provide a straightforward and accessible tool for anyone interested in learning or preserving 
        the Memoni language.
